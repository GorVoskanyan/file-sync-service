# file-sync-service
This is a file synchronization service that monitors a folder on your local machine and syncs it with a cloud storage provider (e.g., Yandex Disk). The service periodically checks for changes in the local folder (new files, updates, deletions) and mirrors those changes in the cloud storage.
